        " 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - Object-Oriented Programming is a method of programming that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. These objects can hold data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data.\n",
        "   \n",
        "     Key Concepts of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Object: An instance of a class. It contains actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class). It hides internal details and only exposes what is necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Inheritance: Allows one class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent).\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Polymorphism: The ability to perform a task in different ways. For example, the same method name can behave differently based on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Abstraction: Hides complex details and shows only the essential features to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "------\n",

        " 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects in Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
        "It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the object will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * A class groups related data and behavior together.\n",
        "\n",
        "     * It does not occupy memory until an object is created from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Multiple objects can be created from the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "            def __init__(self, brand):\n",
        "               self.brand = brand\n",
        "            def drive(self):\n",

        " 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - Abstraction is the concept in Object-Oriented Programming that focuses on hiding the complex details and showing only the necessary features to the user. It helps to simplify things by letting the user interact with the system without worrying about how everything works behind the scenes. For example, when you use a TV remote, you only see the buttons you need to press, not the complex circuitry inside. In programming, abstraction is done using abstract classes or interfaces that define what actions an object can perform without showing how these actions are implemented.\n",
        "\n",
        "     On the other hand, encapsulation means bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that work on that data into a single unit, usually a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which protects the data from being changed accidentally or inappropriately. This is usually done by making variables private and providing public methods to access or update them safely. For example, a medicine capsule hides the bitter medicine inside to protect the user from the taste, similar to how encapsulation hides data inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "     In short, abstraction hides complexity by showing only important details, while encapsulation hides data by controlling access to it. Both help in making programs easier to use and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "------\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods that are surrounded by double underscores (i.e., __method__). These methods allow you to define how instances of your classes behave when they are used with built-in Python functions or operators. Understanding dunder methods is crucial for creating custom objects that behave like built-in types or implementing operator overloading in Python. Some commonly used dunder methods are:\n",
        "\n",
        "          * __init__(self, ...)\n",
        "\n",
        "          * __str__(self)\n",

        "            class MyClass:\n",
        "               def __init__(self, x):\n",

        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "   - Inheritence plays a significant role in an object oriented programming language. Inheritence in python refers to the child class receiving the parent's class properties. The reuse of code is main goal of inheritence. Instaed of developing from scartch when developing a new class, we can use the existing class instead of re-creating it from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "          class BaseClass:\n",
        "             #body of base class\n",

        "             #body of derived class\n",
        "\n",
        "    Types of inheritence in OOPS:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Single inheritence - When a class has only one parent, it is said to have a single inheritence. One class for child and one class for parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Mutiple inheritence - One child class may inherit from several parent classes when there is multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Multilevel inheritence - A class inherits from a child class or derived class under multilevel inheritance. Think of three classes: A, B, and C. Superclass A, child class B, and child class C are all subclasses of A. In other words, multilevel inheritance is the term used to describe a set of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Hierarchial inheritence - A single parent class gives rise to multiple child classes under hierarchical inheritance. To put it another way, we can say that there is one parent class and several child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Hybrid inheritence - When inheritance consists of multiple types or a combination of different inheritance is called hybrid inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "-----\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - In OOP, polymorphism refers to an object's capacity to assume several forms. Simply said, polymorphism enables us to carry out a single activity in a variety of ways. From the Greek words poly (many) and morphism (forms), we get polymorphism. Polymorphism is the capacity to assume several shapes.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Method overriding polymorphism enables us to define child class methods with the same names as parent class methods. The act of overriding an inherited method in a child class is referred to as method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "     In python, polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Example (Method Overriding):\n",
        "            class Animal:\n",
        "              def sound(self):\n",
        "                print(\"Some sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "            class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "              def sound(self):\n",
        "                print(\"Bark\")\n",
        "\n",
        "            class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "              def sound(self):\n",
        "                print(\"Meow\")\n",
        "\n",
        "            animal = animal()\n",
        "            dog = Dog()\n",
        "            cat = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "            animal.sound()  #output: Some sound\n",
        "            dog.sound()     #output: Bark\n",
        "            cat.sound()    #output: Meow\n",
        "\n",
        "--------\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is a Python technique for combining data and functions into a single object. A class, for instance, contains all the data (methods and variables). Encapsulation refers to the broad concealment of an object's internal representation from areas outside of its specification.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Assume, for instance, that you combine methods that provide read or write access with an attribute that is hidden from view on the exterior of an object. Then, you may limit who has access to the object's internal state and hide particular pieces of information. Without giving the program complete access to all of a class's variables, encapsulation provides a mechanism for us to obtain the necessary variable. This method is used to shield an object's data from other objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "     In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Public: No underscore (accessible everywhere)\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Protected: Single underscore _ (convention to restrict access)\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Private: Double underscore __ (strongly restricts access using name mangling)\n",
        "\n",
        "--------\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - A constructor is a particular method used in object-oriented programming to generate and initialise an object of a class. In the class, this method is defined. When an object is created, the constructor is automatically run.Declaring and initialising a class's instance and data member variables is the main function of the constructor. An object's attributes are initialised by the constructor, which is a collection of statements (i.e., instructions) that run when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Syntax of constructor :\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "   Types of Constructor:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Default Constructor\n",
        "     * Non-Parameterized Constructor\n",
        "     * Parameterized Constructor\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example (default constructor):\n",
        "         class person:\n",
        "           def display(self):\n",
        "             print(\"Inside display\")\n",

        "         man = display()\n",
        "         man.display()   #output: Inside display\n",
        "\n",
        "------\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They can access or modify class state that applies across all instances of the class. Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "           class Employee:\n",
        "             company_name = \"ABC Corp\"\n",
        "\n",
        "             @classmethod\n",
        "             def change_company(cls, new_name):\n",
        "                cls.company_name = new_name\n",
        "           Employee.change_company(\"XYZ Ltd\")\n",
        "           print(Employee.company_name)  # Output: XYZ Ltd\n",
        "\n",
        "      Static methods are methods that belong to the class and don't access or modify class or instance state. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Example:\n",
        "           class Math:\n",
        "              @staticmethod\n",
        "              def add(a, b):\n",
        "                return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "           print(Math.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        " 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "   - Method overloading is the practice of invoking the same method more than once with different parameters. Method overloading is not supported by Python. Even if you overload the method, Python only takes into account the most recent definition. If you overload a method in Python, a TypeError will be raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "             def mul(x, y):\n",
        "               z = x*y\n",
        "               print(z)\n",
        "             def mul(p, q, r):\n",
        "               s = p*q*r\n",
        "               print(\"Output:\", s)\n",
        "             mul(5, 2, 3)  #Output: 30\n",
        "\n",
        "---------\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "   -  In Python, method overriding is the process of providing a different implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass within a subclass. It enables the subclass to define its own version of a method with the same name and parameters as the method in the superclass. When a method is overridden, the subclass implements the method in its own way, which overrides the behaviour defined in the superclass. The subclass can then alter or expand the functionality of the inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "      The name, parameters, and return type of the overridden method in the subclass must match those of the method in the superclass. Method overriding occurs only when the subclass has a method with the same name and signature as the superclass method.\n",
        "\n",
        "      When a subclass object is used to call the overridden method during runtime, the subclass implementation is invoked rather than the superclass implementation. A crucial element of polymorphism is the dynamic dispatch of methods based on the actual object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "            class Animal:\n",
        "              def sound(self):\n",
        "                print(\"Some sound\")\n",

        "            cat.sound()    #output: Meow\n",
        " 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - The @property decorator in Python is used to make a method behave like an attribute. It is mainly used to access private data (like variables starting with __) in a safe way. Instead of calling a method like obj.get_value(), you can access it like obj.value, which makes the code cleaner and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "      It's helpful when you want to hide internal variables, but still give controlled access to them. You can also perform calculations or add logic when someone accesses that value.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example:\n",
        "              class Circle:\n",
        "                def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "                   self.__radius = radius\n",

        " 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method or function in their own way. This is important because it helps write flexible, maintainable, and scalable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "      With polymorphism, a single function or method can work with different types of objects, making it easier to manage large programs. It also helps reduce code duplication, as you don't need to write separate methods for each class that performs similar tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Why it's useful:\n",
        "        * Code Reusability: One method can be reused for different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "        * Extensibility: New classes can be added easily without modifying existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "        * Cleaner Code: Makes code easier to read and maintain.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        " 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "   - Abstraction allows you to construct abstract classes and methods that give a high-level interface without providing the implementation specifics. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and must be subclassed. They may contain abstract methods that are declared but not implemented in the abstract class itself.

        "   - Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "         * Modularity - Code is divided into classes and objects, making it easy to manage and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "         * Reusability - Classes can be reused across different programs using inheritance, saving time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "         * Data Hiding - Using encapsulation, OOP hides internal object details and protects data from outside interference.\n",
        "\n",
        "         * Polymorphism - Allows one function or method to work in different ways, making the code flexible and extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "         * Easy Maintenance - Since code is organized in objects, fixing bugs or updating a feature is easier without affecting other parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "         * Real-world Modeling - OOP is based on real-world objects, making it easier to relate and design applications effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "------------\n",
        "\n",
        " 17. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "   - Multiple inheritance is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming where a single class can inherit from two or more parent classes. This allows the child class to access properties and methods from all its parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "       It helps in reusing code and combining features from multiple sources, but it also brings complexity, especially when parent classes have methods with the same name.\n",
        "\n",
        "       Example:\n",
        "               class Father:\n",
        "                 def skills(self):\n",
        "                     print(\"Father: Cooking, Driving\")\n",
        "\n",
        "               class Mother:\n",
        "                 def hobbies(self):\n",
        "                     print(\"Mother: Painting, Singing\")\n",
        "\n",
        "               class Child(Father, Mother):\n",
        "                  def talents(self):\n",
        "                     print(\"Child: Dancing\")\n",
        "\n",
        "               c = Child()\n",

        "               c.talents()    # Own method\n",
        "\n",
        "        Multiple inheritance allows classes to inherit and combine the behavior of multiple parent classes, providing flexibility in designing complex class hierarchies. However, it's important to carefully consider the design and potential complexities that can arise when using multiple inheritance.\n",

        " 18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "   - In Python, class variables and instance variables are used to store data, but they differ in how and where they are used.\n",
        "   \n",
        "      A class variable is shared among all instances of the class. It is defined inside the class but outside any methods. This means all objects of the class can access and share the same value of a class variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "      On the other hand, an instance variable is unique to each object. It is usually defined inside the __init__() method using self, and it stores data specific to that object. While class variables are useful for storing common values (like a school name), instance variables are used for object-specific data (like student name or grade).\n",
        "      \n",
        "      For example, if we have a class Student with a class variable school_name and instance variables name and grade, each student object will have its own name and grade, but all students will share the same school name.\n",

        "\n",
        " 19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "   - __str__(self): Its main purpose is to provide a human-readable or friendly string representation of an object. This is used when you want to display the object to end users, such as when printing the object with print() or converting it to a string with str().\n",
        "\n",
        "      __repr__(self): Its purpose is to provide a detailed and unambiguous string representation of the object, mainly for developers. The output of __repr__ is intended to help with debugging and should ideally be a string that could be used to recreate the object if needed. It is used by the repr() function and in the interactive interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------------\n",
        "\n",
        " 20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "   - The super() function is used to call a method from the parent (super) class inside a child class. It allows the child class to inherit and extend the behavior of the parent class without explicitly naming the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Why is it important?\n",
        "\n",
        "      * It helps in code reuse by accessing parent class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Makes it easier to work with multiple inheritance by handling method resolution order (MRO) automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Avoids the need to hardcode the parent class name, making code more maintainable and flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "---------------\n",
        "\n",
        " 21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "   - The __del__ method is a special method called a destructor. It is automatically invoked when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "       Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "      * To clean up resources (like closing files, releasing network connections) before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "      * It helps in freeing up memory or performing any necessary final tasks for the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------------\n",
        "\n",
        " 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "   - Class methods are methods that are bound to the class, not to an instance. They receive the class itself as the first parameter, usually named cls. Class methods can access or modify the class state, which affects all instances of the class. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Static methods belong to the class but do not access or modify the class or instance state. They behave like regular functions but belong to the class's namespace. Static methods do not take self or cls as the first argument. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "----------\n",
        "\n",
        " 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "   - Inheritance is the primary application of polymorphism. The traits and methods of a parent class are passed down to a child class through inheritance. A subclass, child class, or derived class is a new class that is created from an existing class, which is referred to as a base class or parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Method overriding polymorphism enables us to define child class methods with the same names as parent class methods. The act of overriding an inherited method in a child class is referred to as method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------------------\n",
        "\n",
        " 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "   -  Method chaining is a programming technique where multiple methods are called one after another on the same object in a single line of code. This is possible because each method returns the object itself (self), allowing the next method to be called immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "      The main purpose of method chaining is to make the code more concise, readable, and expressive. Instead of writing multiple statements for each method call, you can chain them together smoothly. This is especially useful when you want to perform a series of operations on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------------\n",
        "\n",
        " 25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "   - The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When you use parentheses () after an object, Python internally calls the object's __call__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "       * To make an object callable, behaving like a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "       * Useful for creating objects that can be used as functions with state or behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "       * Enables more flexible and intuitive interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "       Example:\n",
        "                class Greeter:\n",
        "                  def __call__(self):\n",
        "                     print(\"Hello!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "                g = Greeter()\n",
        "                g()   \n",
